    "## Question 3: Creating Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plots\n",
    "A Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) gives us a probability distribution for a continuous variable from a set of observed data points. Our histogram gives us some information about the distribution of AQI in Livermore - we can see how often we observe an AQI that falls within a certain bin over the first 9 months of 2023. But because histograms are binned and discretize data, the amount of information we can get about a continuous variable will always be limited by the size of the bins.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how to create a KDE, we have to first figure out what \"kernel\" means. A kernel is a weighting function, and it shares certain mathematical properties with probability density functions (it always evaluates to a non-negative and real value, and its integral - or the area under the curve - equals 1).  Kernels are also *even*, meaning the value they return is independent of the sign of the argument. ([source](https://chemicalstatistician.wordpress.com/2013/06/09/exploratory-data-analysis-kernel-density-estimation-in-r-on-ozone-pollution-data-in-new-york-and-ozonopolis/)).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "KDE \"applies\" the kernel on a grid of points along the support of your data set. Like the edges of bins in a histogram, these points need not correspond to actual observations in your data set.  They are just equally spaced points, as they were in the histogram examples above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean to \"apply\" the kernel to a point on the support?  Put simply, the kernel measures how many observations in the data set are close by. The kernel returns a higher number if the point is in a crowded part of the support, and a lower value if the point is by itself. Different kernels weight the importance of nearby observations differently.  Some give equal weight to all observations in a range, and others give more weight to observations at the center of the kernel, i.e. the point where you're evaluating the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's nice about the construction of KDE kernels is that the collective evaluation of the kernel along all the grid points you chose on the support can be interpreted as a probability distribution. (This is because the kernels are carefully defined in mathematical terms to ensure this resulting property.) That is, if you plot all those kernel evaluations as a function of the points where you evaluated them and then connect those points together, the resulting curve is an estimate of the probability density function of the underlying data. Below is an example of what a KDE might look like for ozone concetrations measured at two locations ([source](https://chemicalstatistician.wordpress.com/2013/06/09/exploratory-data-analysis-kernel-density-estimation-in-r-on-ozone-pollution-data-in-new-york-and-ozonopolis/)).<br>\n",

Another way to show a distribution is a box and whisker plot. It's a much more summarized version of your distribution.

In Seaborn, the [`sns.boxplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html) function has a parameter called \"whis\". By default, \"whis\" is equal to 1.5.  This positions the whiskers at 1.5 times the distance from the median to the 25th and 75th percentiles. In this case we say the whiskers span 1.5 times the \"interquartile range.\"  Many scientific papers use this default.  You can also set `whis = [lo hi]` where `lo` and `hi` are numbers between zero and 100 and represent the position of the whiskers by percentile of the distribution. (For example, `whis = [5, 95]` would position the whiskers at the 5th and 95th percentiles).  <br>\n",

In our case, `liv_pm25` contains 2 more observations than `berkeley` - you can confirm this using the `.shape` method.
