    "This notebook works with PG&E's 'wire down' data to explore building a model that can predict whether or not a failure in PG&E's distribution system was caused by a third party.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data we'll play with come from PG&E's wildfire mitigation plan docs [here](https://www.pge.com/en_US/safety/emergency-preparedness/natural-disaster/wildfires/wildfire-mitigation-plan.page?WT.mc_id=Vanity_wildfiremitigationplan).  The wire down data are part of the \"Supplemental Data Request\" in the 2019-2020 docs.  The file is big, so only click [this link](https://www.pge.com/pge_global/common/pdfs/safety/emergency-preparedness/natural-disaster/wildfires/wildfire-mitigation-plan/SDR.zip) if you're ready to download 70MB!"
