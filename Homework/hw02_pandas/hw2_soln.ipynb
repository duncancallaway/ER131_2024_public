This homework is graded based on the total number of correct answers. Each question receives 1 or 2 points. 1 point questions receive full credit if answered correctly.  Otherwise they receive 0 points. 2 point questions receive full credit if answered correctly.  If students make progress on the question but donâ€™t answer correctly they receive 1 point.
