Both the `aug28` and the `ca_locations` contain latitude and longitude coordinates. Let's take advantage of this and define a function that finds the distance between any two points given each point's latitude and longitude values. We can use the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) formula; i.e., if we have one set of points $(a_1,b_1)$, and another set of points $(a_2,b_2)$, the distance between them is:<br>\n",

If you wanted to accurately look at distances between latitude-longitude pairs over a larger area of the globe, you would have to use a slightly more involved trigonometry formula (and may depend on the projection in which you are working)."
