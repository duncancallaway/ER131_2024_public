    "# Methane leak detection\n",
    "Methane is the dominant hydrocarbon in natural gas.  When methane leaks into the atmosphere without being burned, it generates significantly more climate damages on a pound for pound basis than CO2.  Although methane is valuable, a surprising amount of it leaks from pipelines, storage facilities, even the pipes in your home; most estimates are that more than 2% of methane leaks into the atmosphere before being burned or used for other purposes.  That means that 25% or more of the climate damages associated with natural gas use come from leaks, rather than from burning the gas and emitting CO2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, as you might imagine, preventing so-called \"fugitive emissions\" of methane is therefore an extremely important goal for the climate change mitigation community.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data presented in this notebook give you a chance to explore the state of the art in terms of oil and gas facility monitoring and modeling for methane.  The data originally come from the study documented in [this](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/2935/) paper and downloaded [here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/OX4QOA).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set inspired a [follow-on study](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2020/20) that won a best paper award at NeurIPS 2020.  The basic gist of the NeurIPS paper is to predict what facilities will have very large leaks and allocate inspection and repair resources on the basis of those predictions.  It's a really nice example of how prediction model output can be used in a nuanced way for good resource allocation decisions."
