    "# Overview\n",
    "A feeder is bundle of high capacity electrical wires leaving an electricity substation.  PG\\&E has about 3,000 feeders, and each one typically serves a few hundred to a few thousand electricity customers.  In much of PG\\&E, feeders are supported by wooden poles, though underground feeders are becoming more common.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This data set organizes information for each feeder in PG\\&E, and it's a subset of the data used in [this](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac8d18/meta) paper.  You can think of each row in the dataset we're about to load in as a \"day in the life of a feeder\".  That is, each row represents data that were true for the feeder on that day.  Some things don't change (feeder length, voltage level).  But other things do -- like whether or not an ignition ocurred on that day, or the day's maximum wind speed. \n",

    "# Things you could do with these data:\n",
    "I'll give you a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The data lend themselves cleanly to a 'classification' problem.  Specifically, you could build models that classify feeders into two groups: those that are likely to experience an ignition on a given day, and those that are not.  We'll be learning lots of tools in the course to support that type of modeling.\n",
    "2. You could also merge data on public safety power shutoffs (PSPS) to try to predict PSPS durations based on feeder characteristics.  This would be a regression problem. We'll learn lots of tools in the course for those, too.  \n",
    "3. If we decide where to cut off power using risk measures from a predictive model built with these data, what types of communities are most likely to be impacted by the cut offs?  You could use spatial information on where feeders are located along with census data for this analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But you should think for yourselves.  If you're interested in the grid, wildfire, and public safety, this would be a really fun area to learn more about to come up with your own questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that I have data sets that cover more time (back to 2015) and with many more features. These are too big to keep on github, but they are available to you if you wish.  I do not think datahub would easily accommodate the file sizes, but one of our connector assistants could potentially help you find workarounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, these data can be merged with other geospatial information if you wish.  We can get you centroids of each feeder, or even shapefiles that describe the entire geographic scope of each feeder. "
